# Anti Rage Queue 😡♟
## A chrome extension that prevents elo loss from immediately rage / ego queueing on Chess.com

### Features 💻
-Can set the cooldown time
-Can set the amount of games before a cooldown activates

### How 🤔
This "works" without using an API by checking for a game loss, and disabling all buttons that let you begin a new match for the amount of time you set.

### Bugs 🐛
Throws errors when you refresh / go to a new area of chess.com, but still seems to work otherwise. Just needs some try/catch statements in a few places.
